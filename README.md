The dataset for this project was worked on in Microsoft Excel. The dataset is quite simple and easy to understand since it is about sales.
The most important aspect of the project is not in the simplicity of the dataset but in the techniques used to work on the dataset.
A major technique that was used is the cell referencing across multiple sheets. Functions such as XLOOKUP, UNIQUE, and CONCAT were also used.
Lastly, the combo box was used in the place of slicers.
